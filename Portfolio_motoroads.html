                <h1>Project:
                <br>Bay Area Motoroads 
                </h1>
                <br>
                <h2  id="moto_detail">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The goal of the workflow is to create a project that visualizes multiple datasets via an 
                    embedded Experience Builder web application. Experience Builder is an out of the box ESRI tool 
                    that facilitates the creation of dashboards, maps and other configurable data dissemination 
                    tools. I utilized this project to improve on my familiarity using experience builder, 
                    leveraging QGIS plugins and webpage development.</p>

                <h2>Study Area</h2>
                    <p>The area that I selected to observe is the Northern region of the Bay Area in California. 
                    The study area spans across Sonoma, Marin, Lake, Napa, Solano and Yolo counties. These counties 
                    are known for agriculture, open space and excellent motorcycling roads.</p>

                <h2>Data and Data Processing</h2>
                    <p>The shapefiles were originally downloaded using the QGIS plugin for Open Street Maps. 
                    I selected my personal favorite motorcycling roads individually and integrated them 
                    into new layers. Trimming and appending lines was necessary to allow for longer 
                    sections of road and consistent attribute allocation. Once all of the roads were 
                    selected, I merged the road layers into one layer and added fields for pavement 
                    and type. Pavement type indicated road surface using qualitative observations 
                    from the field and includes if the road is unpaved. Unknown pavement is listed 
                    simply as "paved". I also added a new field for "type" which reflects the ideal style 
                    of motorcycle for that particular road. This was based on personal opinion and attributes
                    including pavement surface, visual curve analysis and personal opinion.  One example of this
                    is roads that contain unpaved or rough roads were selected as “Dual Sport”. 
                    Dual Sport refers to a motorcycle that is capable of both on and off road riding.</p>
 
                <h2>Methods</h2> 
                    <p>Once the layer was prepared, I upload it to ArcGIS Online where I changed 
                    the settings to make the map available for public viewing. The Motoroads map was then
                    seamlessly imported into ESRI Experience Builder.
                    I developed the map with the perspective that users could utilize this tool to explore and 
                    learn about new roads with a lens that is specific to motorcycling. I wanted to make the 
                    tool easy and fun to use, informative and simple in design. I used the filters widget to 
                    help users see roads that they will be most interested in with the toggle of a filter.</p>
                    
                <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The web page shows a map on the right. 
                    Selected motorcycling roads are highlighted and symbolized by the type of pavement 
                    or unpaved. On the left is the symbology and a filter to toggle the best roads for 
                    that the type of riding. Below is a detailed view of the attributes related to that 
                    segment of road. The user can explore my favorite motorcycling roads in the bay area 
                    and get an idea of new locations to explore for themselves. The webpage works on both 
                    Edge and Chrome. The webpage also works on Chrome mobile, however the toggles are too 
                    small to select on a touchscreen and I plan to adjust this in the future.</p>
