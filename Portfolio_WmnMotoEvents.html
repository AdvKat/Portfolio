                <h1>Project:
                <br>Bay Area Motoroads 
                </h1>
                <br>
                <h2  id="moto_detail">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The goal of the workflow is to create a project that visualizes multiple datasets via an 
                    embedded Experience Builder web application with an integrated Survey 123 application. 
                    Survey 123 allows users to submit data to the map that is featured in Experience Builder.
                    I utilized this project to hone my skill with integrating interactive ESRI products such as 
                    Experience Builder and Survey 123.</p>

                <h2>Study Area</h2>
                    <p>The area centers the contiguous United States however, I may choose to expand on this in the future 
                    as more data becomes available.
                    </p>

                <h2>Data and Data Processing</h2>
                    <p> The data was originally sourced through multiple locations on the web referenced below.
                        I utilized the event address details and copy/pasted them into Google My Maps. I exported
                        the layer as a KMZ and added the data to a new ArcGIS Pro project. I created the following fields:
                       <ul>
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Event Type</li>
                            <li>Start Date</li>
                            <li>End Date</li>
                            <li>Address</li>
                            <li>City</li>
                            <li>State</li>
                            <li>Cost</li>
                            <li>Website</li>
                            <li>Details</li>
                            <li>Event Image</li>
                       </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p> I manually included this data for all of the created points. I utilized domains for 
                            the Event Type field for consistency and ease of use. I shared the map as a AGOL 
                            feature layer and made the layer public. I created a survey using Survey 123 the served to
                            create additional points on a new layer. I included both layers in a Webmap and associated
                            the map with a Web Experience.  The experience was created to display a map of motorcycling
                            events centering women, show a list with details, dates and locations and include a Survey 123 widget
                            to collect additional data points from users.
                        </p>
